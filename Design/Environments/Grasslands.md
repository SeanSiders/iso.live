# Grasslands
*A refreshing, very open-ended environment, encapsulating a perfect spring day. The feel is slightly secluded, but a steady heart warming breeze brings the ongoing grassy plains to life.*

- Vast grassy plains
- Mountains 100km off in the distance
- A sporadic mix of rocks and glowing stones
- Creek beds, bleeding out to 1km drop off waterfalls
- Massive ridge lines where the waterfalls occur, exposing more grassy plains and creeks far below
